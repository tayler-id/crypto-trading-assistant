# Progress: Crypto Trading Assistant (2025-05-09)

## 1. What Works

- **Project Setup:** Node.js project initialized, dependencies installed.
- **Basic Structure:** Core files (`index.js`, `.env`, `README.md`, `.clinerules`) and directories (`src`, `config`, `memory-bank`) created.
- **API Initialization:** Alpaca and Google Gemini clients are initialized using credentials loaded from `config/.env`.
- **Account Balance Fetching:** `fetchAccountBalance` function successfully calls the Alpaca API (`getAccount`) and parses `equity` and `buying_power` as floats. Logging for these values is corrected.
- **Market Data Fetching (Enhanced):**
    - `getMarketData` function successfully calls CoinGecko API endpoints to fetch:
        - Current Bitcoin price (`/simple/price`). Logging for price is corrected.
        - Historical prices, market caps, and total volumes for 60 days, daily interval (`/coins/{id}/market_chart`).
        - OHLC data for the last day (`/coins/{id}/ohlc`).
    - Calculates SMA7 and SMA50 from historical closing prices.
- **AI Recommendation (Enhanced & More Resilient):**
    - `getTradingRecommendation` function uses an enhanced prompt for Google Gemini.
    - Parses the AI response to extract BUY, SELL, or HOLD using `/\b(BUY|SELL|HOLD)\b/i` (also corrected in retry logic).
    - Includes retry logic for Gemini API calls (specifically for 503 errors), defaulting to 'HOLD' and logging correctly if retries fail.
- **Trade Execution (Enhanced & Corrected):**
    - `executeTrade` function:
        - Includes logic to place a market BUY order via Alpaca API using notional value.
        - **Added `time_in_force: 'gtc'` to `alpaca.createOrder` for crypto orders.**
        - Correctly uses `marketIndicators.currentPrice`.
        - Implemented SELL logic: checks for existing Bitcoin position and closes it. Handles 404 errors if no position exists.
        - **Retry logic refactored to a `while` loop to prevent recursion, attempting the specific trade action.**
        - Added checks for valid `buyingPower` and logs `notionalAmount`.
        - Added logging for Alpaca API error details.
- **Error Handling (Improved):** `try...catch` blocks for API calls. Retry mechanisms for `executeTrade` (non-recursive) and `getTradingRecommendation`. Specific handling for 422, 403, 401 errors in `executeTrade` to prevent retrying non-transient errors.
- **Scheduling:** `node-cron` is configured to run the main trading process every 5 minutes.
- **Logging:** Winston set up. Logging for numeric values and AI defaults improved.
- **Version Control:** Git repository up-to-date on GitHub (`https://github.com/tayler-id/crypto-trading-assistant`) with all fixes.
- **Memory Bank:** Core Memory Bank files updated to reflect latest changes.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Improve

- **Technical Indicators:** Integrate more indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).
- **AI Prompt Refinement:** Continue refining the Gemini prompt.
- **Risk Management:** Implement robust risk management.
- **Error Handling:** Further enhance for more specific API errors.
- **Testing:** Thorough paper trading, unit/integration tests, backtesting.
- **Configuration:** More parameters via `.env`.
- **Code Modularity:** Refactor `src/index.js` if it exceeds ~200 lines or complexity warrants.
- **Security:** Review API key handling for production.

## 3. Current Status

- Major bug fixes implemented (recursive retry, `time_in_force`, data parsing, logging).
- Bot is significantly more robust and functional.
- Memory Bank is up-to-date.
- Project is ready for another round of testing by the user.

## 4. Known Issues

- SELL logic only closes the entire position.
- Risk management is still very basic.
- The bot currently only trades Bitcoin (BTC/USD).
- AI recommendation parsing might still need refinement if Gemini API responses vary significantly beyond simple "BUY/SELL/HOLD" keywords.
- The `notionalAmount` for BUY orders (90% of buying power) might still be too large for some paper accounts or specific Alpaca limits, potentially leading to 422 errors if buying power is very high. This needs monitoring.
