# Progress: Crypto Trading Assistant (2025-05-09)

## 1. What Works

- **Project Setup:** Node.js project initialized, dependencies installed.
- **Basic Structure:** Core files (`index.js`, `.env`, `README.md`, `.clinerules`) and directories (`src`, `config`, `memory-bank`) created.
- **API Initialization:** Alpaca and Google Gemini clients are initialized using credentials loaded from `config/.env`.
- **Account Balance Fetching:** `fetchAccountBalance` function successfully calls the Alpaca API (`getAccount`).
- **Market Data Fetching (Enhanced):**
    - `getMarketData` function successfully calls CoinGecko API endpoints to fetch:
        - Current Bitcoin price (`/simple/price`).
        - Historical prices, market caps, and total volumes for 60 days, daily interval (`/coins/{id}/market_chart`).
        - OHLC data for the last day (`/coins/{id}/ohlc`).
    - Calculates SMA7 and SMA50 from historical closing prices.
- **AI Recommendation (Enhanced & More Resilient):**
    - `getTradingRecommendation` function uses an enhanced prompt for Google Gemini, including current price, SMA7, SMA50, and recent OHLC data.
    - Parses the AI response to extract BUY, SELL, or HOLD using `/\b(BUY|SELL|HOLD)\b/i`.
    - Includes retry logic for Gemini API calls (specifically for 503 errors), defaulting to 'HOLD' if retries fail. The regex within the retry block is consistent.
- **Trade Execution (Enhanced & Corrected):**
    - `executeTrade` function includes logic to place a market BUY order via Alpaca API using notional value. **Correctly uses `marketIndicators.currentPrice` for price information.**
    - Implemented SELL logic: checks for existing Bitcoin position and closes it if found. Handles 404 errors if no position exists.
- **Error Handling (Improved):** `try...catch` blocks are implemented for API calls. Retry mechanisms added for `executeTrade` and `getTradingRecommendation` (for 503 errors).
- **Scheduling:** `node-cron` is configured to run the main trading process every 5 minutes. Immediate run on startup is commented out.
- **Logging:** Winston is set up to log to console and files (`logs/combined.log`, `logs/error.log`). Logging messages are included throughout the process.
- **Version Control:** Git repository initialized, `.gitignore` created, and code (including enhancements and fixes) pushed to GitHub (`https://github.com/tayler-id/crypto-trading-assistant`).
- **Memory Bank:** Core Memory Bank files created and populated with initial and updated project details.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Improve

- **Technical Indicators:** While SMA7 and SMA50 are added, other indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.) could be integrated for more comprehensive analysis.
- **AI Prompt Refinement:** Continue refining the Gemini prompt based on testing and performance. Consider more complex strategies or conditional logic in the prompt.
- **Risk Management:** Implement robust risk management (e.g., stop-loss orders, take-profit orders, maximum drawdown limits, position sizing based on risk tolerance).
- **Error Handling:** Further enhance error handling for a wider range of specific API errors (rate limits, insufficient funds, market conditions preventing trade) and improve retry/backoff strategies beyond the current implementations.
- **Testing:** Requires thorough testing in a paper trading environment. Consider unit tests for individual functions and integration tests for the overall workflow. Backtesting capabilities would be valuable.
- **Configuration:** Make more parameters configurable via `.env` (e.g., trade size percentage, risk parameters, specific indicators to use, SMA periods, retry counts/delays).
- **Code Modularity:** The `src/index.js` file is growing. Consider refactoring into smaller, focused modules (e.g., `alpacaService.js`, `marketDataService.js`, `aiService.js`, `tradeService.js`) to adhere to the 200-line limit per file and improve maintainability.
- **Security:** Review API key handling and ensure best practices for security, especially if deploying to a server.

## 3. Current Status

- Core functionality significantly enhanced, including improved resilience and parsing for AI API calls, and correction in trade execution logic.
- Memory Bank updated to reflect these enhancements.
- Project is ready for user configuration (API keys) and more detailed testing of the trading logic.

## 4. Known Issues

- SELL logic only closes the entire position; does not handle partial sells or specific quantities.
- Risk management is still very basic.
- Error handling for specific API scenarios can be further improved.
- The bot currently only trades Bitcoin (BTC/USD).
- The AI recommendation parsing might still need refinement if Gemini API responses vary significantly.
