# Progress: Crypto Trading Assistant (2025-05-08)

## 1. What Works

- **Project Setup:** Node.js project initialized, dependencies installed.
- **Basic Structure:** Core files (`index.js`, `.env`, `README.md`, `.clinerules`) and directories (`src`, `config`, `memory-bank`) created.
- **API Initialization:** Alpaca and Google Gemini clients are initialized using credentials loaded from `config/.env`.
- **Account Balance Fetching:** `fetchAccountBalance` function successfully calls the Alpaca API (`getAccount`).
- **Market Data Fetching:** `getMarketData` function successfully calls the CoinGecko API (`/simple/price`) to get the current Bitcoin price.
- **AI Recommendation:** `getTradingRecommendation` function successfully calls the Google Gemini API with a formatted prompt and parses the response (validating for BUY/SELL/HOLD).
- **Trade Execution (Basic):** `executeTrade` function includes logic to place a market BUY order via Alpaca API using notional value.
- **Error Handling (Basic):** `try...catch` blocks are implemented for API calls. A simple retry mechanism is added to `executeTrade`.
- **Scheduling:** `node-cron` is configured to run the main trading process every 5 minutes.
- **Logging:** Winston is set up to log to console and files (`logs/combined.log`, `logs/error.log`). Basic logging messages are included throughout the process.
- **Version Control:** Git repository initialized, `.gitignore` created, and initial code pushed to GitHub (`https://github.com/tayler-id/crypto-trading-assistant`).
- **Memory Bank:** Core Memory Bank files created and populated.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Improve

- **SELL Logic:** The `executeTrade` function currently has placeholder logic for SELL recommendations. Needs implementation (e.g., checking current position, placing sell order).
- **Technical Indicators:** Currently only fetching price. Need to integrate fetching or calculation of other indicators (RSI, moving averages, etc.) as mentioned in the initial request and incorporate them into the AI prompt.
- **AI Prompt Refinement:** The current Gemini prompt is basic. It needs refinement based on testing and potentially including more market context/indicators for better recommendations.
- **Risk Management:** No risk management (e.g., stop-loss, position sizing rules beyond simple percentage) is implemented.
- **Error Handling:** Needs enhancement (e.g., specific handling for rate limits, network issues, API-specific errors, more sophisticated retry/backoff).
- **Testing:** Requires thorough testing in a paper trading environment. Backtesting capabilities could be added.
- **Configuration:** More parameters could be made configurable (e.g., trade size percentage, risk parameters, specific indicators to use).
- **Code Modularity:** While functions exist, the core logic is in one file (`index.js`). Could be broken down into modules (e.g., `alpacaClient.js`, `marketDataClient.js`, `aiClient.js`, `tradeExecutor.js`) for better organization, especially if complexity increases (respecting the 200-line limit rule).

## 3. Current Status

- Core development based on the initial task description is complete.
- Memory Bank creation and population are complete.
- Project is ready for user configuration (API keys) and initial testing.

## 4. Known Issues

- SELL logic is not implemented.
- Only basic market data (price) is used.
- AI prompt is basic.
- Error handling is basic.
- No sophisticated risk management.
