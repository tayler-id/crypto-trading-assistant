# Active Context: Crypto Trading Assistant (2025-05-09)

## 1. Current Work Focus

- Updating Memory Bank files to reflect safer BUY logic (check existing position, fixed notional amount for testing).
- Committing and pushing updated Memory Bank to GitHub.
- Preparing to re-run the bot for testing.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Core Logic Enhancements & Fixes in `src/index.js`:**
    - `getMarketData` function fetches current Bitcoin price, historical data, OHLC data, and calculates SMA7 & SMA50.
    - `getTradingRecommendation` uses an enhanced prompt for Gemini, with robust parsing and retry logic for 503 errors.
    - `executeTrade` function:
        - Includes logic for BUY and SELL orders.
        - Corrected to use `marketIndicators.currentPrice`.
        - Added `time_in_force: 'gtc'` to `alpaca.createOrder`.
        - Refined retry logic to a `while` loop and corrected non-retryable error condition.
        - Added checks for valid `buyingPower`.
        - **Implemented check for existing position before placing a BUY order.**
        - **Changed BUY order notional amount to a fixed $100 for safer testing (instead of a percentage of buying power).**
    - Corrected various logging statements for clarity.
- Git repository updated with these enhancements and fixes.
- Memory Bank files previously created and populated.

## 3. Next Steps

- Update remaining relevant Memory Bank files (`progress.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) with details of the safer BUY logic.
- Commit updated Memory Bank files to the Git repository.
- Push updated Memory Bank to GitHub.
- Request user to stop any currently running instance of the bot.
- Run the bot (`node src/index.js`) for testing and observe logs.
