# Active Context: Crypto Trading Assistant (2025-05-09)

## 1. Current Work Focus

- Updating Memory Bank files to reflect the addition of retry logic for the Gemini API.
- Committing and pushing updated Memory Bank to GitHub.
- Preparing to run the bot for testing as per user request.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Core Logic Enhancements in `src/index.js`:**
    - `getMarketData` function now fetches:
        - Current Bitcoin price.
        - Historical prices, market caps, and total volumes (for 60 days, daily interval).
        - OHLC data for the last day.
    - Calculated SMA7 and SMA50 based on historical closing prices.
    - `getTradingRecommendation` function now uses a significantly enhanced prompt for Gemini, including current price, SMA7, SMA50, and recent OHLC data.
    - Implemented more robust parsing of the AI recommendation.
    - **Added retry logic to `getTradingRecommendation` for Gemini API calls (specifically for 503 errors), defaulting to 'HOLD' if retries fail.**
    - `executeTrade` function now includes logic to:
        - Check for existing Bitcoin positions using `alpaca.getPosition()`.
        - Close the entire position if a SELL recommendation is received and a position exists, using `alpaca.closePosition()`.
        - Handle 404 errors from `getPosition()` gracefully (when no position exists).
    - Commented out the immediate `runTradingProcess()` call at the end of `src/index.js` to rely on the cron scheduler.
- Git repository updated with these enhancements.
- Memory Bank files previously created and populated.

## 3. Next Steps

- Update remaining relevant Memory Bank files (`progress.md`, `systemPatterns.md`) with details of the Gemini API retry logic.
- Commit updated Memory Bank files to the Git repository.
- Push updated Memory Bank to GitHub.
- Run the bot (`node src/index.js`) for testing and observe logs.
