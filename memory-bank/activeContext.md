# Active Context: Crypto Trading Assistant (2025-05-09)

## 1. Current Work Focus

- Updating Memory Bank files to reflect the correction of market indicator property name in `executeTrade`.
- Committing and pushing updated Memory Bank to GitHub.
- Preparing to re-run the bot for testing.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Core Logic Enhancements & Fixes in `src/index.js`:**
    - `getMarketData` function fetches current Bitcoin price, historical data (60 days), OHLC data (last day), and calculates SMA7 & SMA50.
    - `getTradingRecommendation` uses an enhanced prompt for Gemini.
    - Implemented robust parsing of the AI recommendation using `/\b(BUY|SELL|HOLD)\b/i`.
    - Added retry logic to `getTradingRecommendation` for Gemini API calls (specifically for 503 errors), defaulting to 'HOLD' if retries fail.
    - Corrected the regex within the Gemini API retry logic to use `/\b(BUY|SELL|HOLD)\b/i` for consistent parsing.
    - `executeTrade` function includes logic for BUY orders and SELL orders (closing existing positions), with 404 error handling for `getPosition`.
    - **Corrected `executeTrade` to use `marketIndicators.currentPrice` instead of `marketIndicators.price`.**
    - Commented out the immediate `runTradingProcess()` call.
- Git repository updated with these enhancements and fixes.
- Memory Bank files previously created and populated.

## 3. Next Steps

- Update `progress.md` in the Memory Bank with details of the corrected market indicator property name.
- Commit updated Memory Bank files to the Git repository.
- Push updated Memory Bank to GitHub.
- Request user to stop any currently running instance of the bot.
- Run the bot (`node src/index.js`) for testing and observe logs.
