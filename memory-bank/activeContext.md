# Active Context: Crypto Trading Assistant (2025-05-09)

## 1. Current Work Focus

- Updating Memory Bank files to reflect recent significant enhancements to the core trading logic.
- Committing and pushing updated Memory Bank to GitHub.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Core Logic Enhancements in `src/index.js`:**
    - `getMarketData` function now fetches:
        - Current Bitcoin price.
        - Historical prices, market caps, and total volumes (for 60 days, daily interval).
        - OHLC data for the last day.
    - Calculated SMA7 and SMA50 based on historical closing prices.
    - `getTradingRecommendation` function now uses a significantly enhanced prompt for Gemini, including current price, SMA7, SMA50, and recent OHLC data.
    - Implemented more robust parsing of the AI recommendation.
    - `executeTrade` function now includes logic to:
        - Check for existing Bitcoin positions using `alpaca.getPosition()`.
        - Close the entire position if a SELL recommendation is received and a position exists, using `alpaca.closePosition()`.
        - Handle 404 errors from `getPosition()` gracefully (when no position exists).
    - Commented out the immediate `runTradingProcess()` call at the end of `src/index.js` to rely on the cron scheduler.
- Git repository updated with these enhancements.
- Previous Memory Bank files created and populated.

## 3. Next Steps

- Populate remaining core Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) with details of the recent enhancements.
- Update `prompts.md` in the Memory Bank to reflect the new, more detailed Gemini prompt.
- Commit updated Memory Bank files to the Git repository.
- Push updated Memory Bank to GitHub.
- Hand over to the user for configuration and testing of the enhanced bot.
