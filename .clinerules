# Crypto Trading Assistant Project Rules

This file contains project-specific rules and intelligence for the Crypto Trading Assistant.

## Code Structure

- Keep individual code files under 200 lines; break larger files into smaller, modular components.

## Command Execution

- Use semicolons (`;`) for command chaining in PowerShell.

## API Key Management

- API keys and sensitive configuration should be stored in a `.env` file in the `config/` directory.

## Error Handling

- Implement robust error handling for API calls and trade execution, including retry logic where appropriate.

## Logging

- Use the configured Winston logger for all application logging.

## Development Workflow

- Plan extensively before executing tool calls.
- Reflect on the outcomes of previous tool calls to inform subsequent steps.
- Do not rely solely on tool calls; incorporate analytical thinking and planning.
